    <p>Hello, my name is Alvaro Ramos. Currently, I am a graduate student in Psychology at San Francisco State University (SFSU). I received my bachelor's in Psychology at Sonoma State University. Previously I have had experiences contributing to academic research, public policy research, and statistical instruction. During my career, I have developed analytical, research, and teaching skills. These skills have been developed over time from my previous experiences.</p>
